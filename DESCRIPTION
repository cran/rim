Description: Provides an interface to the powerful and fairly complete computer algebra system maxima.
    It can be used to start and control maxima from within R by entering 'Maxima' commands. 
    It facilitates outputting results from 'Maxima' in 'LaTeX' and 'MathML'. 2D and 3D plots can be displayed directly. This package also registers a 'knitr'-engine 
    enabling 'Maxima' code chunks to be written in 'RMarkdown' documents.
